# My Portfolio Site
## About
### Summary
I want to be able to bring my ideas to the world quickly and at low cost, so I'm building myself a portfolio site in the MERN stack. This project will give me a custom platform to share information with the world. Simultaneously, I'm developing the skills I need to rapidly prototype and ship future software products.

### Status
I'm now **moving my site to Next.js.** The framework I started on, Create React App, has been deprecated and was breaking my builds.

Once I'm finished rebuilding, I'll move on to  **Stage 2.1**: "Implement a MERN backend to retrieve data for the Projects and Blogs pages."

### Goals
My ambitions for this project are to:
1. Create a place where I can share my projects, research, and knowledge with interested people.
2. Develop strong fundamental web development skills, and explore interesting advanced topics.
3. Hone my project management skills for self-directed projects. I want to perform self-directed machine learning research for my next project, so it's important to learn highly efficient, structured workflow practices.
4. Inspire other students to pursue their own self-directed learning.
5. Demonstrate a technical competency to future employers.

### Technologies
I am using the MERN stack for this project. I chose this stack because it has
- Strong support from large companies, giving it a long expected lifetime.
- High-quality learning resources on Coursera, my platform of choice.
- Ease of use and high development velocity.
- Strong demand in the global job market.
- Extensive package support.

| Express JS    | Backend API       | No                |
| MongoDB       | Database          | No                |

### Development cycle
I'm following the Waterfall development cycle for a couple of reasons:
1. I've followed Agile at Chubb, UniMate, and in several uni courses, but I have little experience with Waterfall. I'd like to experience the benefits and drawbacks of both.
2. I don't expect the project requirements to evolve much with user feedback.
3. I don't want to ship a public-facing representation of myself if it's not finished.
4. I want to give myself time to explore, evaluate, test, and implement these unfamiliar technologies. Efficiency is not a primary goal this time around.

## Project Plan
### Stage 1: Setup, Design and Placeholder Implementation
1. Find some frontend design inspiration. ‚úÖ
2. Build the app structure. ‚úÖ
3. Draft the app's key pages and components: ‚úÖ
    - Landing page. ‚úÖ
    - Header component. ‚úÖ
    - Footer component. ‚úÖ
    - Projects page. ‚úÖ
    - Contact page. ‚úÖ
4. Add internal navigation/routing using React Router. ‚úÖ
5. Complete some basic interface improvements: ‚úÖ
    - Write example content for the Blog page and Contact page. ‚úÖ
    - Add placeholder shapes, logos, and links to all components. ‚úÖ
6. Take blog notes on the development process, particularly focusing on: problems I've faced during development; how I've overcome them; and what I learned through these challenges. ‚úÖ
7. Write a formal project plan and README. ‚úÖ
8. Refactor my Stage 1 work, to implement
    - SOLID design principles. ‚úÖ - This will require more reviews as we go. It looks OK for now.
    - Newest, minimal Bootstrap syntax. ‚ùå - Decided not to, for now. It would obscure the (HCJ) interface I am programming to.
    - Self-documenting, or docstring'd, code. ‚úÖ
    - Particularly, refactor:
        - Blogs. ‚úÖ
        - Contact. ‚úÖ
        - Header. ‚úÖ
        - Footer. ‚úÖ
        - Landing. ‚úÖ
        - Nav panel. ‚úÖ
        - Projects. ‚úÖ

### Stage 2: Backend and Content Addition
1. Design and build a MERN backend to retrieve data for the Projects, Blogs, and Email List pages.
    - Design the databases. ‚úÖ
        - Specify the database requirements. Justify your choices. ‚úÖ
        - Choose a technology. Justify your choice. ‚úÖ
        - Design a NoSQL database structure for user services. ‚úÖ
        - Design a second NoSQL database structure for logging. ‚úÖ
    - Design the backend. ‚úÖ
        - Design the API using the ExpressJS framework on NodeJS. ‚úÖ
        - Implement the API using NodeJS. ‚úÖ
            - Mock up locally. No tests this time around. I can learn that later. ‚úÖ
        - Implement the server. ‚úÖ
            - Upload test data. ‚úÖ
            - Integration test via frontend click-through. ‚úÖ
    - Secure the backend. ‚úÖ
        - Research backend security issues. ‚úÖ
        - Design + implement basic security features. ‚úÖ

### Stage 3: Frontend and backend re-design
1. I want to learn some design skills by making a frontend from scratch. Since this isn't a portfolio, I can go a bit wild.
    - Design on Figma. ‚úÖ
    - Iterate until you're happy with it. ‚úÖ (this took ages!)
2. Implement the new frontend.
    - Intro
    - Essays
    - Projects
    - Art
        - Stories
        - Poems?
        - Images
    - Contact
    - Outro
    - Credits
3. The Express backend isn't cooperating with NextJS. I've learned the low-level stuff on Express, so it's best to transition to Next now, for simplicity.
    - Rewrite the backend API in pure (serverless) NextJS
    - Add data to the Projects and Essays databases
        - Projects: UniMate, SumoBots, this site. Don't go overboard, just the basics. You can do the analysis later.
        - Essays: Everything from AISoc (needs to be tidied up but again, can do that later :))
    - Integrate the backend with the new frontend
    - Add bug reporting somewhere
    - Add essay mailing list signup
4. Take some dot notes on the frontend redesign and development process
5. Add animations
6. Simplify for mobile and implement a mobile UI, or add a blocker to prevent people from viewing on mobile

### Stage 4: Launch prep
1. Integrate Vercel monitoring and analytics
2. Go live. Run final click-through tests
3. Promote the launch on social media

### Stage 5: Writeup
9. Write a capstone blog about the development process, including
    - How I like the new technologies I've used.
    - What I did well.
    - What I could do better.
    - What are my next steps with this project.
    - What did I want to do but skipped, and why.

### Stage 6: Enhancement
1. Build some interactive features and promote them via socials to get traffic
