# My Portfolio Site
## About
### Summary
I want to be able to bring my ideas to the world quickly and at low cost, so I'm building myself a portfolio site in the MERN stack. This project will give me a custom platform to share information with the world. Simultaneously, I'm developing the skills I need to rapidly prototype and ship future software products.

### Status
I'm now **upgrading the full website stack from my v0.2 first draft.** I've completed a draft frontend and backend in v0.1 and v0.2 respectively. Now I want to add personality, polish, and best-practice programming throughout my project. That means
* Designing a new UI,
* Adjusting the project module structure,
* Finishing the transition from Express/Node to Next.js serverless, and
* Adding advanced features like accessibility/animations/SEO/responsive interfaces.

See dev-notes/todo for more info.

### Goals
My ambitions for this project are to:
1. Create a place where I can share my projects, research, and knowledge with interested people.
2. Develop strong fundamental web development skills, and explore interesting advanced topics.
3. Hone my project management skills for self-directed projects. I want to perform self-directed machine learning research for my next project, so it's important to learn highly efficient, structured workflow practices.
4. Inspire other students to pursue their own self-directed learning.
5. Demonstrate a technical competency to future employers.

### Technologies
I am using the MERN stack for this project. I chose this stack because it has
- Strong support from large companies, giving it a long expected lifetime.
- High-quality learning resources on Coursera, my platform of choice.
- Ease of use and high development velocity.
- Strong demand in the global job market.
- Extensive package support.

| Express JS    | Backend API       | Yes               |
| MongoDB       | Database          | Yes               |

### Development cycle
I'm following the Waterfall development cycle for a couple of reasons:
1. I've followed Agile at Chubb, UniMate, and in several uni courses, but I have little experience with Waterfall. I'd like to experience the benefits and drawbacks of both.
2. I don't expect the project requirements to evolve much with user feedback.
3. I don't want to ship a public-facing representation of myself if it's not finished.
4. I want to give myself time to explore, evaluate, test, and implement these unfamiliar technologies. Efficiency is not a primary goal this time around.

## Project Plan
### Version 0.1: Setup, Design, Draft Frontend Implementation. ‚úÖ
1. Find some frontend design inspiration. ‚úÖ
2. Build the app structure. ‚úÖ
3. Draft the app's key pages and components. ‚úÖ
4. Add internal navigation/routing using React Router. ‚úÖ
5. Add example content and a placeholder/draft UI. ‚úÖ
6. Take blog notes on the development process, particularly focusing on: problems I've faced during development; how I've overcome them; and what I learned through these challenges. ‚úÖ
7. Write a formal project plan and README. ‚úÖ
8. Refactor to implement cleaner and more readable code. ‚úÖ

### Version 0.2: Draft Backend Implementation. ‚úÖ
1. Design and build a MERN backend to retrieve data for the Projects, Blogs, and Email List pages.
    - Design the databases. ‚úÖ
        - Specify the database requirements. Justify your choices. ‚úÖ
        - Choose a technology. Justify your choice. ‚úÖ
        - Design a NoSQL database structure for user services. ‚úÖ
        - Design a second NoSQL database structure for logging. ‚úÖ
    - Design the backend. ‚úÖ
        - Design the API using the ExpressJS framework on NodeJS. ‚úÖ
        - Implement the API using NodeJS. ‚úÖ
            - Mock up locally. No tests this time around. I can learn that later. ‚úÖ
        - Implement the server. ‚úÖ
            - Upload test data. ‚úÖ
            - Integration test via frontend click-through. ‚úÖ
    - Secure the backend. ‚úÖ
        - Research backend security issues. ‚úÖ
        - Design + implement basic security features. ‚úÖ

### Version 0.3: Frontend and backend re-design
1. I want to learn some design skills by making a frontend from scratch. Since this isn't a portfolio, I can go a bit wild.
    - Design on Figma. ‚úÖ
    - Iterate until you're happy with it. ‚úÖ (this took ages!)
2. Implement the new frontend.
    - Intro
    - Essays
    - Projects
    - Art
        - Stories
        - Poems?
        - Images
    - Contact
    - Outro
    - Credits
3. The Express backend isn't cooperating with NextJS. I've learned the low-level stuff on Express, so it's best to transition to Next now, for simplicity.
    - Rewrite the backend API in pure (serverless) NextJS
    - Add data to the Projects and Essays databases
        - Projects: UniMate, SumoBots, this site. Don't go overboard, just the basics. You can do the analysis later.
        - Essays: Everything from AISoc (needs to be tidied up but again, can do that later :))
    - Integrate the backend with the new frontend
    - Add bug reporting somewhere
    - Add essay mailing list signup
4. Take some dot notes on the frontend redesign and development process
5. Add animations
6. Simplify for mobile and implement a mobile UI, or add a blocker to prevent people from viewing on mobile

### Version 0.4: Launch prep
1. Integrate Vercel monitoring and analytics
2. Go live. Run final click-through tests
3. Write a capstone blog about the development process, including
    - How I like the new technologies I've used.
    - What I did well.
    - What I could do better.
    - What are my next steps with this project.
    - What did I want to do but skipped, and why.

### Version 0.5: Launch
1. Promote the site on social media
2. Build some interactive features and promote them via socials to get traffic
