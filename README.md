# My Portfolio Site
## About
### Summary
I want to be able to bring my ideas to the world quickly and at low cost, so I'm building myself a portfolio site in the MERN stack. This project will give me a custom platform to share information with the world. Simultaneously, I'm developing the skills I need to rapidly prototype and ship future software products.

### Status
I'm now **moving my site to Next.js.** The framework I started on, Create React App, has been deprecated and was breaking my builds.

Once I'm finished rebuilding, I'll move on to  **Stage 2.1**: "Implement a MERN backend to retrieve data for the Projects and Blogs pages."

### Goals
My ambitions for this project are to:
1. Create a place where I can share my projects, research, and knowledge with interested people.
2. Develop strong fundamental web development skills, and explore interesting advanced topics.
3. Hone my project management skills for self-directed projects. I want to perform self-directed machine learning research for my next project, so it's important to learn highly efficient, structured workflow practices.
4. Inspire other students to pursue their own self-directed learning.
5. Demonstrate a technical competency to future employers.

### Technologies
I am using the MERN stack for this project. I chose this stack because it has
- Strong support from large companies, giving it a long expected lifetime.
- High-quality learning resources on Coursera, my platform of choice.
- Ease of use and high development velocity.
- Strong demand in the global job market.
- Extensive package support.

### Development cycle
I'm following the Waterfall development cycle for a couple of reasons:
1. I've followed Agile at Chubb, UniMate, and in several uni courses, but I have little experience with Waterfall. I'd like to experience the benefits and drawbacks of both.
2. I don't expect the project requirements to evolve much with user feedback.
3. I don't want to ship a public-facing representation of myself if it's not finished.
4. I want to give myself time to explore, evaluate, test, and implement these unfamiliar technologies. Efficiency is not a primary goal this time around.

## Project Plan
### Version 0.1: Setup, Design, Draft Frontend Implementation. ‚úÖ
1. Find some frontend design inspiration. ‚úÖ
2. Build the app structure. ‚úÖ
3. Draft the app's key pages and components. ‚úÖ
4. Add internal navigation/routing using React Router. ‚úÖ
5. Add example content and a placeholder/draft UI. ‚úÖ
6. Take blog notes on the development process, particularly focusing on: problems I've faced during development; how I've overcome them; and what I learned through these challenges. ‚úÖ
7. Write a formal project plan and README. ‚úÖ
8. Refactor to implement cleaner and more readable code. ‚úÖ

### Version 0.2: Draft Backend Implementation. ‚úÖ
1. Design and build a MERN backend to retrieve data for the Projects, Blogs, and Email List pages.
    - Design and implement the MongoDB databases and collection schemas. ‚úÖ
    - Design, implement and secure the Node-Express backend. ‚úÖ
2. Add test data to the Writing database collections. ‚úÖ
3. Add a Professional Experience page. ‚úÖ
4. Take blog notes on the development process so far. ‚úÖ

### Version 0.3: Upgrade the Full Stack.
