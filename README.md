# My Portfolio Site Project
## Status
‚úÖ  Complete.

## Summary
I built a MERN portfolio site to learn to bring my ideas and prototypes to the world quickly, at low cost. I learned core full-stack web development (in MERN) skills, frontend design (in Figma), web hosting (on Vercel), and some web networking concepts, completely from scratch. After successfully implementing the site, I transitioned to a hosted Wordpress instance to cut down on future maintenance and modification time, allowing me to focus on machine learning technologies instead. This was a fantastic experience in web dev!

## Goals
1. Create a place where I can share my projects, research, and knowledge.
2. Develop some full-stack web development skills.
3. Hone my project management skills for self-directed projects, to prepare for self-directed projects in machine learning.
4. Inspire other learners.
5. Demonstrate a technical competency to future employers.

## Technologies
I am using the MERN stack for this project. I chose this stack because it has
- Strong support from large companies, giving it a long expected lifetime.
- High-quality learning resources on Coursera, my platform of choice.
- Ease of use and high development velocity.
- Strong demand in the global job market.
- Extensive package support.

## Development cycle
I followed the _Waterfall_ development cycle:
1. I'd followed Agile before, but I had no experience with Waterfall.
2. I didn't expect the project requirements to evolve.
3. I wanted to give myself time to explore unfamiliar technologies. Efficiency is not a primary goal.
